# Knife Piece Reminder

A TBoI mod that reminds you to get the knife pices on your way to Mother.

## Fixes:

- `save`ing and `load`ing of the mod's settings
- if a reminder is rendered and you exit the game, when you come back the reminder wont render (fixed)
- reminder is still rendered when a knife piece is picked up until you go to the next level (fixed)
- removed unused variables
- code restructured
- refactoring to make code readability better
